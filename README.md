United Way is looking for an effective way to visualize its monthly aggregate program performance data. The challenge is to build
a platform that can help united way efficiently view and analyze complex data models in a longitudinal and/or year-to-date format.
There should be multiple visualizations views to represent the data for different users (i.e. general public v. stakeholder meetings)
and to compare performance data against performance targets.
